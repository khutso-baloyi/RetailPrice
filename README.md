# Functionality
The app should allow the customer to scan a product:
- if a product does not exist, query the customer to add the product or 'cancel'
- if the product exists, display the previous price and query the customer to update price or 'cancel'

# integration
the application cross-references all customers previous scanned prices to keep the database updated.

## to-do list
create an ERD for the database
create pages for viewing in shopping-list, create a checking mechanism for the products,
create a page to scan the products.

# Database information

## The ERD for the DB

this ERD is straight forward. 3 tables that will help me store user credentials, store which stores they shop from and which products have been captured on the application and their prices
